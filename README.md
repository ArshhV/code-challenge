### 📋 Getting Started

This project uses Yarn as the package manager and has a unified start command for both frontend and backend.

To get started:

1. Install Yarn if you don't have it already: `npm install -g yarn`
2. Install dependencies and start both frontend and backend: `yarn start`

The backend will run on port 3001.
The frontend will run on port 3000.

### 🎯 Project Focus & Testing

This project was developed as part of a frontend role application. The primary focus has been on the frontend implementation.

- **Frontend Tests**: All frontend tests can be run using `yarn test`.
- **Backend**: The backend was created using AI tools to supplement the frontend development and provide a functional API.
